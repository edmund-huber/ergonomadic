# What about federation?

IRC federation solves a problem that was more likely to occur on the internet of
1991 than today. We are exploring alternatives to federation that avoid nickname
and channel sync issues created during netsplits.

# Installation

```sh
go get
go install
cp ergonomadic.yaml ircd.yaml
vim ircd.yaml  # modify the config file to your liking
ergonomadic initdb
```
